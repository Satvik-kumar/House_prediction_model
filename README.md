# House Price Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves predicting house prices using a variety of machine learning models. The dataset used for this analysis includes various features that influence the price of houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to create an accurate model that can predict house prices based on these features.

## Introduction

House price prediction is a common task in the real estate industry, where accurate price estimation can significantly impact buying and selling decisions. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle/Real Estate Listings](#). It contains the following features:
- **Location**
- **Size (square feet)**
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Year Built**
- **Lot Size**
- **Condition**

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves:
- Understanding the distribution of variables
- Identifying missing values
- Visualizing relationships between features and target variable (price)
- Detecting outliers

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing/standardizing numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Modeling

We use various machine learning models to predict house prices:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared Score (RÂ²)

## Results

The results of the models are compared based on their evaluation metrics. The model with the best performance is selected for final predictions.

## Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes the findings of the project, the performance of the models, and the overall effectiveness of the chosen approach.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include:
- Incorporating additional features (e.g., neighborhood amenities)
- Trying different model architectures (e.g., neural networks)
- Further hyperparameter tuning
